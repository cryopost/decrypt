## Deployment

This project can be easily deployed to GitHub Pages or any static hosting service:

```

## Technical Details

- Built with Next.js 15 and TypeScript
- Uses the same `tlock-js` and `drand-client` libraries as the main Cryopost frontend
- Completely client-side - no server required
- Based on the proven Timevault approach

## Security

This tool runs entirely in your browser. No message data is ever sent to any server. The decryption happens locally using the drand timelock network.
